How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can do testing, I can have other people look at my work, I can try to look at things from the other side as if I was the attacker, etc.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The best way to interpret user needs is to sit down and talk with the customer in order to ensure there is a common understanding 
of what is expected from the software.


How do I approach designing software?

I think the best approach is always by making sure I have a firm grasp on what is required of me, and also ensuring i'm maintaining 
communication with other developers on what is going on.
